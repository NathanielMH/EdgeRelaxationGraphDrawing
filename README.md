# EdgeRelaxationGraphDrawing
Primary repository for the research project on edge selection for relaxation and graph drawing

## 💡 Idea 
Look at the effect that relaxing an edge has on graph beauty metrics (number of crossings, average length of edges, ...) in terms of different characteristics of that edge as well as on the perturbation of the drawing/resulting objective function.

## ⏱️ To do
- Find and use benchmark random graph generator
- Find normalization on all edge features, KK gradient size and expansion factor in terms of the size of the graph to do inter graph comparations
- Find those most correlated or a linear combination of those most correlated to the bettering of graph beauty metrics
- Test findings with randomly generated graphs
- Write findings
